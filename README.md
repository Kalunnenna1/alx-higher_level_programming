0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
Background Context
OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!

Read or watch the below resources in the order presented.

Resources
Read or watch:

Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet)
Object-Oriented Programming (Please *be careful*: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything in the following paragraphs: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes (You DON’T have to learn about class attributes), Methods, The __init__ Method, “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “Public, Protected, and Private Attributes”)
Properties vs. Getters and Setters

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
More Info
Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments. Example Google Style Python Docstrings

Tasks
0. My first square
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

You are not allowed to import any module

1. Square with size
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
You are not allowed to import any module
Why?

Why size is private attribute?

The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as class builder, must control the type and value of this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.

2. Size validation
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
You are not allowed to import any module

3. Area of a square
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module

4. Access and update private attribute
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
You are not allowed to import any module
Why?

Why a getter and setter?

Reminder: size is a private attribute. We did that to make sure we control the type and value. Getter and setter methods are not 100% Python, but more OOP. With them, you will be able to validate the assignment of a private attribute and also define how getting the attribute value will be available from outside - by copy? by assignment? etc. Also, adding type/value validation in the setter will centralize the logic, since you will do it in only one place.
